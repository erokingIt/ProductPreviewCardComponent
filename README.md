## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Used paint.net to determine component colors, dimensions, and padding/margins
- Shopping cart css icon downloaded from [https://css.gg/shopping-cart](https://css.gg/shopping-cart)

### What I learned

- Learned how to use flexbox and make flexbox responsive.
- Using css icons rather than a image file.
- Became aware of the "i" tag and using it for css icons.
- Using html5 article and figure tag

### Continued development

I want to use more html5 tags where appropiate. I tried using the img tag for the product image but a inset border kept displaying around the image. I changed the tag to div when I could not correct this issue. I'd like to investigate this further.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Icons](https://css.gg/) - Provided free open-source css icon for the button.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Helped me gain understanding of flexbox.
